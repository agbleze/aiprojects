  <h4>
    AI & ML Engineer | Data Scientist | GTS-Ready | Entrepreneurial Mindset

  <p>
    I design and deploy intelligent systems—from proof of concept to production—that balance
    accuracy, cost, and speed. By optimizing big-data pipelines and implementing robust MLOps,
    I’ve cut time-to-market by 40 % and reduced infrastructure costs by 30 %.

  <p>
    My playbook includes production-ready AI patterns, continuous monitoring loops, and automated
    retraining workflows that keep models sharp in real-world conditions.  
    <i>Let’s build data-driven solutions that scale, adapt, and deliver.</i>
